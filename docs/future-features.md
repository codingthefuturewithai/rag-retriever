# Future Features & Critical Improvements

This document outlines potential future enhancements being considered for RAG Retriever. These features focus on addressing critical functionality gaps and improving the overall user experience. The features listed here are not guaranteed to be implemented but represent our current thinking on important improvements.

## Document Management

Critical features needed for proper document lifecycle management:

### Content Deduplication & Updates

1. **Duplicate Prevention**

   - Check if URL/file already exists in database before processing
   - Use source identifier (URL/filename) + content hash for uniqueness
   - Skip processing if content unchanged (unless forced)

2. **Update Mechanisms**

   - `--force-update` flag to re-process existing content
   - Smart diffing to only update changed sections
   - Versioning support for tracking content changes
   - Metadata to track last update time and source

3. **Content Reprocessing**
   - Ability to reprocess existing content with new chunk settings
   - Batch reprocessing of all documents in a collection
   - Migration tools for handling configuration changes
   - Progress tracking and error recovery for large migrations

### Collection Management

1. **Document Organization**

   - Separate collections for different document sources/types
   - Hierarchical collection structure (e.g., docs by domain/project)
   - Collection-level metadata and settings

2. **Deletion Capabilities**
   - Delete individual documents by ID/source
   - Remove entire collections
   - Bulk deletion with filtering options
   - Cleanup of orphaned embeddings

## Document Source Integrations

Priority integrations with common documentation platforms:

1. **Swagger/OpenAPI Specifications**

   - API documentation
   - Endpoint specifications
   - API schemas

2. **Notion Workspaces**

   - Team documentation
   - Project specifications
   - Knowledge bases

3. **Google Workspace**
   - Technical documentation
   - Design documents
   - Team collaboration docs

## Vector Store Enhancements

### Vector Store Analysis

1. **Data Inspection & Metrics**

   - GUI dashboard for vector store exploration
   - View collection statistics and health metrics
   - Analyze embedding distributions and clustering
   - Export/import capabilities for backup and transfer

2. **Document Analysis**
   - Browse raw document content and metadata
   - View relationships between similar documents
   - Track document update history
   - Analyze chunk quality and coverage

### Search Quality Improvements

1. **Cross-Encoder Reranking**

   - Add reranking model for better result relevance
   - Configurable reranking thresholds
   - Modified search pipeline with reranking stage

2. **Hybrid Search**
   - Combined semantic and keyword search
   - Configurable scoring weights
   - Improved handling of technical terms/code

### Reliability & Performance

1. **Fallback Mechanisms**

   - Detection of low-quality results
   - Multiple search strategies
   - Result merging from different approaches

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Batch processing for large document sets
   - Improved chunking strategies
   - Caching of frequently accessed results
